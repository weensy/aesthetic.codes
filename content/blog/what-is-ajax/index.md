> **Asynchronous Javascript And Xml**

A technique for loading data for only part of a page without having to refresh the entire page using the browser's XMLHttpRequest object.

Ajax makes a request to the server via an XMLHttpRequest object so that only a portion of the html page can be updated.

In this case, only necessary data is updated in JSON or XML format, which saves resources and time.
